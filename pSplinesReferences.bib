	abstract = "In the analysis of survival data, it is usually assumed that any unit will experience the event of interest if it is observed for a sufficiently long time. However, it can be explicitly assumed that an unknown proportion of the population under study will never experience the monitored event. The promotion time model, which has a biological motivation, is one of the survival models taking this feature into account. The promotion time model assumes that the failure time of each subject is generated by the minimum of N independent latent event times with a common distribution independent of N. An extension which allows the covariates to influence simultaneously the probability of being cured and the latent distribution is presented. The latent distribution is estimated using a flexible Cox proportional hazard model where the logarithm of the baseline hazard function is specified using Bayesian P-splines. Introducing covariates in the latent distribution implies that the population hazard function might not have a proportional hazard structure. However, the use of P-splines provides a smooth estimation of the population hazard ratio over time. The identification issues of the model are discussed and a restricted use of the model when the follow-up of the study is not sufficiently long is proposed. The accuracy of our methodology is evaluated through a simulation study and the model is illustrated on data from a Melanoma clinical trial."

	abstract={We present a new Bayesian nonparametric approach to estimating the spectral density of a stationary time series. A nonparametric prior based on a mixture of B-spline distributions is specified and can be regarded as a generalization of the Bernstein polynomial prior of Petrone (Scand J Stat 26:373--393, 1999a; Can J Stat 27:105--126, 1999b) and Choudhuri et al. (J Am Stat Assoc 99(468):1050--1059, 2004). Whittle's likelihood approximation is used to obtain the pseudo-posterior distribution. This method allows for a data-driven choice of the number of mixture components and the location of knots. Posterior samples are obtained using a Metropolis-within-Gibbs Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, and mixing is improved using parallel tempering. We conduct a simulation study to demonstrate that for complicated spectral densities, the B-spline prior provides more accurate Monte Carlo estimates in terms of {\$}{\$}L{\_}1{\$}{\$}L1-error and uniform coverage probabilities than the Bernstein polynomial prior. We apply the algorithm to annual mean sunspot data to estimate the solar cycle. Finally, we demonstrate the algorithm's ability to estimate a spectral density with sharp features, using real gravitational wave detector data from LIGO's sixth science run, recoloured to match the Advanced LIGO target sensitivity.},

In such instances, these are shown to correspond to a frequentist P-splines model with a predefined and severe roughness penalty parameter, an obviously undesirable feature. It is shown that the specification of a hyperprior distribution for one parameter of that prior distribution provides the desired flexibility. Alternatively, a mixture prior can also be used. An extension of these two models by enabling adaptive penalties is provided. The posterior of all the proposed models can be quickly explored using the convenient Gibbs sampler."

They can be systematically derived from multivariate distributions with known marginals, yielding e.g. the normal and the Student copulas. Alternatively, one can restrict his/her interest to a sub-family of copulas named Archimedean. They are characterized by a strictly decreasing convex function on (0,1) which tends to +∞ at 0 (when strict) and which is 0 at 1. A ratio approximation of the generator and of its first derivative using B-splines is proposed and the associated parameters estimated using Markov chains Monte Carlo methods. The estimation is reasonably quick. The fitted generator is smooth and parametric. The generated chain(s) can be used to build “credible envelopes” for the above ratio function and derived quantities such as Kendall's tau, posterior predictive probabilities, etc. Parameters associated to parametric models for the marginals can be estimated jointly with the copula parameters. This is an interesting alternative to the popular two-step procedure which assumes that the regression parameters are fixed known quantities when it comes to copula parameter(s) estimation. A simulation study is performed to evaluate the approach. The practical utility of the method is illustrated by a basic analysis of the dependence structure underlying the diastolic and the systolic blood pressures in male subjects."

	abstract = {B-spline representation of the dielectric functions provides many theoretical and practical benefits for material modeling in spectroscopic ellipsometry. However, the number of knots (and their locations, in general) defines actual performance of B-splines in ellipsometric data analysis. On the one hand, too large number of knots can result in serious overfitting of the experimental data. On the other hand, this number should be sufficient to fit all essential spectral features. Selection of the right number of knots is, in practice, a very subjective and empirically-driven task. In this paper, we discuss the choice of the number of knots utilizing three well-established versions of statistical information criteria in form of Akaike, corrected Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria (AIC, AICc and BIC, respectively). The criteria establish a compromise between over- and underfitting of experimental data and allow formalized selection of the right number of knots. Effectiveness of the proposed methodology is illustrated using a few real-data examples.}

The model is formulated in a Bayesian framework, and the estimation relies on reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) methods. For a given segmentation of the time series, the likelihood function is approximated via a product of local Whittle likelihoods. Thus, no parametric assumption is made about the process underlying the time series. The number and lengths of the segments are assumed unknown and may change from one MCMC iteration to another.

	abstract = {We consider asymptotic problems in spectral analysis of stationary causal processes. Limiting distributions of periodograms and smoothed periodogram spectral density estimates are obtained and applications to the spectral domain bootstrap are given. Instead of the commonly used strong mixing conditions, in our asymptotic spectral theory we impose conditions only involving (conditional) moments, which are easily verifiable for a variety of nonlinear time series.},

	URL = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/2983994},
	abstract = {The difficulty in constructing smoothing formulae is to express quantitatively the type of smoothness one expects of the curve one is estimating. An argument is given in Sections 1 and 3 for formulating this "smoothness hypothesis" in terms of the properties of a population of curves of which the curve being estimated is a member. In equation (20) we obtain a solution for the matrix of optimum weighting coefficients in terms of certain "population moments" of the ordinates of the curve. Explicit formulae based on special assumptions are deduced in equations (34), (56)-(58). General information is gained on the way the optimum smoothing function and the variance of the smoothed estimate vary with the sample size and with the assumed degree of smoothness of the parent curve.},
